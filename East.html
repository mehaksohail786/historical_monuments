      <h3>Qavam House</h3>
      <p>Qavam House (also widely called, Narenjestan-e Ghavam) is a traditional and historical house and garden in Shiraz, Iran, built between 1879 and 1886. The building preserves the elegance and refinement enjoyed by the upper-class families during the 19th century. The paintings on the low ceilings of the house are inspired by Victorian-era Europe. The mirrored porch was a focal point of the house, overlooking a small garden that was designed with fountains, date palms, and flowering plants.

      <h3>Si-o-se-pol</h3>
      <p>The Allahverdi Khan Bridge (Persian: پل الله‌وردی خان), popularly known as Si-o-se-pol (Persian: سی‌وسه‌پل, lit. '[the] bridge of thirty-three [spans]'), is the largest of the eleven historical bridges on the Zayanderud, the largest river of the Iranian Plateau, in Isfahan, Iran.[2]

        The bridge was built in the early 17th century to serve as both a bridge and a dam. It is a popular recreational gathering place, and is one of the most famous examples of Iran's Safavid architecture.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>See more details</summary>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Si-o-se-pol (meaning the bridge of 33 Persian) was built between 1599 and 1602, under the reign of Abbas I, the fifth Safavid king (shah) of Iran. It was constructed under the supervision of Allahverdi Khan Undiladze, the commander-in-chief of the armies, who was of Georgian origin, and was also named after him. The bridge served particularly as a connection between the mansions of the elite, as well as a link to the city's vital Armenian neighborhood of New Julfa.

          In years of drought (2000–02 and 2013), the river was dammed upstream to provide water for Yazd province.</p>

      <h3>Gonbad-e Qābus برج گنبد قابوس</h3>
      <p>Gonbad-e Qabus or Gonbad-e Qabus Tower (Persian: برج گنبد قابوس) is a monument in Gonbad-e Qabus, Iran, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2012. It marks the grave of Ziyarid ruler Qabus (r. 978–1012), and was built during his lifetime in 1006/7. It is a cylindrical tomb tower that reaches c. 61 metres (200 feet) and can be seen from some 30 kilometres (19 miles) away. The eponymous city is named after the monument.

        Considered to be a masterpiece of Iranian architecture, according to Oleg Grabar, it achieves an "almost perfect balance between a purpose (princely glory beyond death), a form (cylindrical tower transformed into a star), and a single material (brick)". The Gonbad-e Qabus tower is the best known tower tomb in northern Iran and was featured in many publications. </p>
      <details>
        <summary>See more details</summary>
        <h3>Construction, Plan and Design</h3>
        <p>The inscription bands on the tower, written in rhymed prose, state that Qabus ordered the foundation of the tower built during his lifetime, in 1006/7. He was a prince of the Ziyarid dynasty, which was based in the historic Tabaristan region of northern Iran. In the 11th century, this region was still undergoing conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam.

          The foundation date on the monument is given in two calendar styles: Iranian solar and Islamic lunar. The monument has an interior diameter of 9.67 metres (31.7 feet) at its base. According to Sheila S. Blair (2002), the building's entrance contains some of the earliest evidence of the development of the moqarnas structure (i.e. stalactite vaulting) in Iran. In terms of design, the Gonbad-e Qabus tower resembles other cylindrical tomb towers on Iran's Caspian Sea littoral. However, the Gonbad-e Qabus tower differs from other examples because of its "extraordinary height". Taking its conical roof into account, the tower measures c. 50 metres (160 feet) above ground; this is three times its exterior diameter. Sheila S. Blair notes.</p>

        <summary>See more details</summary>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Captain A.M. de Fontaine was, prior to his recruitment as chief commissioner of the British North Borneo Constabulary, a member of the police forces of Singapore. In May 1885, he led an expedition known as the "Puroh Expedition" to search for a Murut Chief, Kandurong, who was known as a cattle thief and head hunter. Under his arrangement, G. L. Davies (Resident of the West Coast), Dr. Donald Manson Fraser, R. M. Little (Resident Assistant) and J. E. G. Wheatley arrived at a village in Kawang on 10 May 1885 along with a detachment of police. As there was a shortage of baggage carriers from the Dusun people to carry items into the mountainous regions of Crocker Range,[1] the Bajau headmen of Kawang were asked to supply them with 30 people. The Bajaus showed little desire to comply with the request by saying that "the carrying of heavy loads is hard for them". Then, the British Resident warned the Bajau headmen that their village would be fined if they did not follow what had been requested. The fight between the resident and the village leader became stronger as a porter from a neighbouring district discovered a stolen water buffalo in the village of the Bajaus. The Bajaus surrendered the water buffalo to the British resident, but the situation remained tense on 12 May as more porters were requested from Papar. The inhabitants of Kawang felt threatened with the request.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Near the end of 1945, it became clear that Japan would lose the war. The Japanese occupation began in Sandakan with the arrest of the town leader.

However, as the US boats left the town in the same night, the Japanese took a chance with already 27 persons in custody; most of them belonged to the Chinese leadership of the town. Those arrested were taken to the headquarters of the Kempeitai. On the basis of alleged confessions, they were convicted in absentia by the District Court of Sandakan. After the reading of the judgement by Captain Nakata Shiruchi, the group been led up to a hill behind the headquarters and shot in groups of four with a machine gun. Other sources indicate that the convicts were beheaded. Even before the execution there were ten burrows dug in which the bodies of the men were buried</p>

      <h3>Gyeongbok Palace </h3>
      <p>Gyeongbokgung (Korean: 경복궁; lit. Blessing Scenery Palace), also known as Gyeongbokgung Palace, was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, it is located in northern Seoul, South Korea. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of the royal family and the seat of government.

        Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares. The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.
        
        In the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan during its occupation of Korea.[3] On January 21, 1963, it was designated as a cultural property.[4] Since the 1990s, the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. It also houses the National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Built in 1969 at a cost of approximately US$2.5 million, Seoul Tower was completed on 3 December 1971, designed by architects at Jangjongryul though at the time the facility interior was not furnished. N Seoul Tower opened to the public in October 1980. Since then, the tower has been a landmark of Seoul. Tower elevation ranges from 236.7 m (777 ft) at the base to 479.7 m (1,574 ft) above sea level. Seoul Tower had its name changed to N Seoul Tower in 2005, with the "N" standing for 'new', 'Namsan', and 'nature.' Approximately 15 billion KRW was spent in renovating and remodeling the tower.

          When N Seoul Tower's original owner merged with CJ Corporation, it was renamed the N Seoul Tower (official name CJ Seoul Tower). YTN acquired it from CJ Corporation in 1999, and changed its name to YTN Seoul Tower.</p>

      <h3>Hwaseong Fortress</h3>
      <p>Hwaseong Fortress or Suwon Hwaseong is a fortification surrounding the centre of Suwon, the provincial capital of Gyeonggi-do, in South Korea.[1] It was built from 1794 to 1796 by King Jeongjo of the Joseon dynasty to house and honour the remains of his father, Prince Sado. Sado had been executed by being locked alive inside a rice chest by his own father King Yeongjo after failing to obey a command to commit suicide. Located 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Seoul and enclosing much of central Suwon, the fortress includes King Jeongjo's palace Haenggung. The fortress and enclosed palace were designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1997. It comprises among many other features the palace, a perimeter wall, four main gates, and two sluicegates over the Suwoncheon, Suwon's main stream, which flows through the centre of the fortress.</p>

        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p>Hwaseong Fortress was built over a two and a half-year period, from 1794 to 1796 according to the designs of the architect Jeong Yakyong, who would later become a renowned leader of the Silhak movement. Silhak, which means practical learning, encouraged the use of science and industry, and Jeong incorporated fortress designs from Korea and China along with contemporary science into his plans. The use of brick as a building material for the fortress and employment of efficient pulleys and cranes were also due to the influence of Silhak.[</p>

      <h3>Changdeokgung</h3>
      <p>Changdeokgung (Korean: 창덕궁; lit. The Palace of Prospering Virtue), also known as Changdeokgung Palace or Changdeok Palace, is set within a large park in Jongno District, Seoul, South Korea. It is one of the "Five Grand Palaces" built by the kings of the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897).[1] As it is located east of Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeokgung—along with Changgyeonggung—is also referred to as the "East Palace" (동궐; 東闕; Donggwol).

        Changdeokgung was the most favored palace of many Joseon kings and retained many elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period that were not incorporated in the more contemporary Gyeongbokgung. One such element is the fact that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. Like the other Five Grand Palaces in Seoul, it was heavily damaged during the Japanese occupation of Korea. (1910–1945). Currently, only about 30% of the pre-Japanese structures of the East Palace Complex (Changdeokgung together with Changgyeonggung) survive.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Changdeokgung was the second palace after Gyeongbokgung which had been established in 1395 as a primary palace. In the midst of strife for the throne between princes and vassals, authority of Gyeongbokgung was deteriorated. King Jeongjong enthroned by Prince Jeong-an (Yi Bang-won), who later became King Taejong, moved the capital to Gaegyeong, the capital of the Goryeo dynasty, again in 1400 on the pretext of its superior geographical features, but in fact, to avert a power struggle. King Taejong (Yi Bang-won) soon took over the throne and returned to Hanseong (present-day Seoul). Taejong was reluctant to build Gyeongbokgung Palace, which had been built by his political opponent Jeong Do-jeon, as well as being the place where he had killed his half-brothers for the throne, and therefore built new palace (named Changdeokgung). Construction of Changdeokgung began in 1405, and was completed in 1412. King Seonjo expanded the palace grounds by about 500,000 square meters, including Huwon (see below).

          The palace was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasion in 1592 by crowd and reconstructed in 1609 by King Seonjo and King Gwanghaegun. The palace burned down again in 1623 because of King Injo a political Revolt against Gwanghaegun. The palace was also attacked by the Manchu Qing but throughout its history of reconstruction and repair has remained faithful to its original design. Changdeokgung was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1868, when the neighboring Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt. Korea's last Emperor, Sunjong lived here until his death in 1926.</p>

      <h3>Great Sphinx of Giza </h3>
      <p>The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion. Facing directly from west to east, it stands on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx appears to represent the pharaoh Khafre. The original shape of the Sphinx was cut from the bedrock, and has since been restored with layers of limestone blocks. It measures 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.[4]

        The Sphinx is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt and one of the most recognizable statues in the world. The archaeological evidence suggests that it was created by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC).
        
        The circumstances surrounding the Sphinx's nose being broken off are uncertain, but close inspection suggests a deliberate act using rods or chisels. Contrary to a popular myth, it was not broken off by cannonfire from Napoleon's troops during his 1798 Egyptian campaign. Its absence is in fact depicted in artwork predating Napoleon, and referred to in descriptions by the 15th-century historian al-Maqrīzī.</p>

          <h5>History</h5>
          <h3>Old Kingdom</h3>
          <p>The archaeological evidence suggests that the Great Sphinx was created around 2500 BC for the pharaoh Khafre, the builder of the Second Pyramid at Giza. The Sphinx is a monolith carved from the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area. Egyptian geologist Farouk El-Baz has suggested that the head of the Sphinx may have been carved first, out of a natural yardang, i.e. a ridge of bedrock that had been sculpted by the wind. These can sometimes achieve shapes which resemble animals. El-Baz suggests that the "moat" or "ditch" around the Sphinx may have been quarried out later to allow for the creation of the full body of the sculpture. The stones cut from around the Sphinx's body were used to construct a temple in front of it, however neither the enclosure nor the temple were ever completed, and the relative scarcity of Old Kingdom cultural material suggests that a Sphinx cult was not established at the time. Selim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, made note of this circumstance.</p>

      <h3>Abu Simbel</h3>
      <p>Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples in the village of Abu Simbel (Arabic: أبو سمبل), Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. It is situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. Their huge external rock relief figures of Ramesses II have become iconic. His wife, Nefertari, and children can be seen in smaller figures by his feet. Sculptures inside the Great Temple commemorate Ramesses II's heroic leadership at the Battle of Kadesh.

        The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 to higher ground to avoid it being submerged by Lake Nasser, the Aswan Dam reservoir. As part of International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, an artificial hill was made from a domed structure to house the Abu Simbel Temples, under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz Michałowski, from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>See more details</summary>
        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p>During his reign, Ramesses II embarked on an extensive building program throughout Egypt and Nubia, which Egypt controlled. Nubia was very important to the Egyptians because it was a source of gold and many other precious trade goods. He, therefore, built several grand temples there in order to impress upon the Nubians Egypt's might and Egyptianize the people of Nubia. The most prominent temples are the rock-cut temples near the modern village of Abu Simbel, at the Second Nile Cataract, the border between Lower Nubia and Upper Nubia. There are two temples, the Great Temple, dedicated to Ramesses II himself, and the Small Temple, dedicated to his chief wife Queen Nefertari.

          Construction of the temple complex started in c. 1264 BC and lasted for about 20 years, until 1244 BC.[citation needed] It was known as the "Temple of Ramesses, beloved by Amun".</p>

      <h3>First Pylon</h3>
      <p>A pylon is a monumental gate of an Egyptian temple (Egyptian: bxn.t in the Manuel de Codage transliteration[1]). The word comes from the Greek term πυλών 'gate'. It consists of two pyramidal towers, each tapered and surmounted by a cornice, joined by a less elevated section enclosing the entrance between them.[2] The gate was generally about half the height of the towers. Contemporary paintings of pylons show them with long poles flying banners.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>See more details</summary>
        <h3>Egyptian Architecture</h3>
        <p>In ancient Egyptian religion, the pylon mirrored the hieroglyph akhet 'horizon', which was a depiction of two hills "between which the sun rose and set".[2] Consequently, it played a critical role in the symbolic architecture of a building associated with the place of re-creation and rebirth.Pylons were often decorated with scenes emphasizing a king's authority since it was the public face of a building. On the first pylon of the temple of Isis at Philae, the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies while Isis, Horus and Hathor look on. Other examples of pylons can be seen in Karnak, Luxor Temple and Edfu. Rituals to the god Amun were often carried out on the top of temple pylons. A pair of obelisks usually stood in front of a pylon.

          In addition to standard vertical grooves on the exterior face of a pylon wall which were designed to hold flag poles, some pylons also contained internal stairways and rooms.[2] The oldest intact pylons belong to mortuary temples from the Ramesside period in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE.</p>

      <h3>Gardens of Babur </h3>
      <p>Bagh-e Babur (Dari: باغ بابر), also known as Gardens of Babur, is a historic site in Kabul, Afghanistan. It is located in the Sher Darwaza hillside of District 5, southwest of Shahr-e Naw, or a short distance south of Kabul Zoo and north of Chihil Sutun. The gardens of Babur has several terraced buildings, a small mosque, and plenty of walking space. Visited by up to one million locals and foreign tourists a year, it is also where the tomb of the first Mughal emperor Babur is located. The park is thought to have been developed around 1504, when Babur gave orders for the construction of an "avenue garden" in Kabul, described in some detail in his memoirs, the Baburnama. It has been re-developed by various Afghan rulers since then.

        It was the tradition of Mughal princes to develop sites for recreation and pleasure during their lifetime and later choose one of these as their last resting place. The site continued to be of significance to Babur's successors; Jahangir made a pilgrimage to the site in 1607, when he ordered that all gardens in Kabul be surrounded by walls, that a prayer platform be laid in front of Babur's grave, and an inscribed headstone placed at its head. During the visit of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1638, a marble screen was erected around the tomb of Babur, and a mosque built on the terrace below. There are accounts from the time of the visit to the site of Shah Jahan in 1638 of a stone water channel that ran between an avenue of trees from the terrace below the mosque, with pools at certain intervals.</p>

          <h5>History</h5>
          <p>The original construction year of Bagh-e Babur is unknown. Relics have recently been found at the site dating to the 3rd century BC. "In the past caravans came from different parts carrying trade loads and they would exchange their trade loads here," according to Bagh-e Babur management. When Babur captured Kabul in 1504 from the Arguns he re-developed the site and used it as a guest house for special occasions, especially during the summer seasons.

            Since Babur had such a high rank, he would have been buried in a site that befitted him. The garden where it is believed Babur requested to be buried is known as Bagh-e Babur. Mughal rulers saw this site as significant and aided in the further development of the site and other tombs in Kabul. In an article written by the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme, describes the marble screen built around the tomb of Babur by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1638 with the following inscription:
            
            only this mosque of beauty, this temple of nobility, constructed for the prayer of saints and the epiphany of cherubs, was fit to stand in so venerable a sanctuary as this highway of archangels, this theatre of heaven, the light garden of the god forgiven angel king whose rest is in the garden of heaven, Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur the Conqueror.</p>

      <h3>Darul Aman Palace</h3>
      <p>Darul Aman Palace (Pashto: د دارالامان ماڼۍ; Dari: قصر دارالامان; 'Abode of Peace' or, in a double meaning, 'Abode of Aman[ullah]') is a three-story-tall palace located in Darulaman, which about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) south-west of the centre of Kabul, Afghanistan. Surrounding the palace are the following buildings: the National Assembly, the National Museum of Afghanistan and the Afghan International University.

        The 150 room Darul Aman Palace was originally built in the 1920s, during the reign of Amanullah Khan. He reigned as Emir of Afghanistan between February 1919 and June 1926, and as King of Afghanistan between June 1926 and January 1929. The palace was severely damaged during the 1990s civil war. However, between 2016 and 2020, the palace was renovated and completely restored to its former glory, work being largely completed for the 100th anniversary of Afghan independence, which was on 19 August 2019.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>See more details</summary>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Construction of the Darul Aman Palace began in the early 1920s as part of the endeavours of Emir Amanullah Khan to modernise Afghanistan. In June 1926, Amanullah proclaimed himself as King of Afghanistan. The palace was to be part of the new capital city called Darulaman, connected to Kabul by a narrow gauge railway. Amanullah Khan invited 22 architects from Germany and France to build the palace. The palace is considered to be a testimony of the Afghan-German ties, as it was designed by German engineer Walter Harten and his team of engineers.

          The palace is an imposing neoclassical building on a hilltop overlooking a flat, dusty valley in the western part of the Afghan capital. Designed by French architects A. Godard and M. Godard, as well as German architects, it was one of the first buildings in the country to get central heating and running water. The Swedish memoir writer Rora Asim Khan, who lived in Afghanistan with her Afghan husband in 1926–27, describe in her memoirs how she was invited to the palace by Queen Soraya to describe Western lifestyle and customs to the Queen and the King's mother Intended as the seat of a future parliament, the building remained unused and partially complete for many years after religious conservatives under Habibullah Kalakani forced King Amanullah from power in 1929, and halted his reforms. In later years it served as the medical school for Kabul University, as well a warehouse, and the seat of several smaller ministries.</p>

      <h3>Id Gah Mosque</h3>
      <p>Eid Gah Mosque or Id Gah Mosque (Dari: مسجد عید‌گاه), is the second largest mosque in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. It is considered the cardinal religious mosque in the country, where a million people offer Eid prayers twice a year. It is located near the Mahmud Khan bridge and National Stadium in the eastern part of the city, in the Shar-e-barq of Kabul, which is one of the wealthier areas of the city. The "Id Gah" or "Eid Gah" refers to an open space where people congregate during national and religious celebrations. The open grounds of Id Gah are also used as a parking lot for trucks that transport goods to and from Peshawar.[1]

        In most references Babur, a Muslim warrior at the time had just invaded India and ordered a Mosque be built to glorify Islam, he had his warriors bring back precious stone from the Punjab, Sindh and surrounding areas and had Persian architects build a structure for his Kabul subjects. It has been the scene of religious festivals, religious ceremonies, state functions such as coronations and priestly religious ceremonies attended by Kings and Amirs. It was from this mosque that the then Amir Habibullah made his historic announcement of his country's independence, in 1919.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Id Gah Mosque was commissioned by Babur the ruler of the Mughal empire before being renovated on a large scale by King Abdur Rahman Khan in 1893 or before. Another story relates to Jahangir being the original builder of this mosque, using local quarries and materials as Kabul was a key mughal city works of art were often commissioned here.

          Afghan history records indicate that in 1901, the then Emir of Afghanistan, the head of the state, publicly performed the priestly functions by celebrating the Id at Id Gah Mosque. The chief priest of Kabul immediately proclaimed Habibullah to be the successor of Mohamed, whereupon the Emir of Afghanistan delivered an address inspired by an "intolerant ecclesiasticism". Among other things the Amir passed a dictum that a fine of up to ten Kabuli Rupees would be levied on all who did not offer prayers in the mosques.</p>
